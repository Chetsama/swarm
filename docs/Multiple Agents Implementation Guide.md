# Implementing LangChain with Multiple Agents: A Comprehensive Guide

Based on my analysis of the Swarm project and research into LangChain patterns, I'll provide you with a comprehensive guide on implementing multiple agents using LangChain principles.

## Key Concepts and Architecture Patterns

### 1. Agent Communication Patterns

LangChain implements several agent communication patterns:

**Sequential Agents**: Each agent completes its task and passes results to the next agent in a pipeline.

**Hierarchical Agents**: An orchestrator agent delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents.

**Cooperative Agents**: Multiple agents work simultaneously, coordinating via shared memory or message queues.

### 2. Core Components

#### Agent Framework
Agents in LangChain typically consist of:
- **AgentExecutor**: Manages execution flow
- **Prompt Templates**: Define agent behavior and context
- **Tools**: Capabilities for agents to interact with external systems
- **Memory**: State persistence between interactions

#### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **AgentRouter**: Directs tasks to appropriate agents
- **Team Coordination**: Synchronization mechanisms for concurrent agents
- **Shared State Management**: Persistent context across agent interactions

## Practical Implementation Strategies

### 1. Architecture Pattern for Multiple Agents

Based on your Swarm project's architecture, here's a robust implementation approach:

```python
# Example multi-agent system structure
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from langchain_core.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
import asyncio

class MultiAgentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
        self.tools = []
        self.router = None
        
    def add_agent(self, name: str, agent_executor: AgentExecutor):
        self.agents[name] = agent_executor
        
    def setup_router(self):
        # Implement agent selection logic
        pass
```

### 2. Agent Communication Flow

The typical flow involves:
1. **Task Analysis**: Determine which agents can handle the task
2. **Agent Selection**: Route to appropriate agent(s)
3. **Execution**: Execute with proper tool usage
4. **Coordination**: Handle inter-agent communication
5. **Result Aggregation**: Combine results from multiple agents

### 3. Implementation Approaches

#### Approach A: Sequential Agent Pipeline
```python
# Sequential execution of agents
async def sequential_agent_execution(task: str, agents: List[AgentExecutor]):
    results = []
    for agent in agents:
        result = await agent.ainvoke({"input": task})
        results.append(result)
        task = result["output"]  # Pass result to next agent
    return results
```

#### Approach B: Cooperative Agent System
```python
# Concurrent execution with coordination
async def cooperative_agent_system(task: str, agents: List[AgentExecutor]):
    # Create tasks for concurrent execution
    tasks = [agent.ainvoke({"input": task}) for agent in agents]
    
    # Execute concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Coordinate results
    return await coordinate_results(results)
```

### 4. Shared State Management

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

class SharedContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {}
        
    def update(self, key: str, value: Any):
        self.state[key] = value
        
    def get(self, key: str):
        return self.state.get(key)
```

## Implementation Strategy for Your Project

Based on the Swarm project structure, here's how to implement LangChain-style multiple agents:

### Step 1: Enhance Agent Communication
Your current setup has Planner, Executor, and Critic agents. To improve it with LangChain concepts:

```python
# Enhanced agent interface
class EnhancedAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, llm, tools: List[Tool], memory=None):
        self.name = name
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.memory = memory or ConversationBufferMemory()
        
    async def execute(self, task: str):
        # Implement agent-specific logic
        pass
```

### Step 2: Implement Agent Router
```python
class AgentRouter:
    def __init__(self, agents: Dict[str, AgentExecutor]):
        self.agents = agents
        
    def route_task(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Determine which agent should handle the task
        # This could be based on keywords, complexity, or other factors
        pass
```

### Step 3: Enable Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
class MultiAgentCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, agents: List[EnhancedAgent]):
        self.agents = agents
        self.shared_memory = {}
        
    async def coordinate_agents(self, task: str):
        # Execute agents in appropriate order/parallelism
        # Manage shared state
        # Handle dependencies between agents
        pass
```

## Key Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Tool Integration
Ensure tools are properly integrated with agents:

```python
# Tool definition for file operations
file_tools = [
    Tool(
        name="list_files",
        func=filesystem.list_files,
        description="List files in a directory"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="read_file", 
        func=filesystem.read_file,
        description="Read content of a file"
    )
]
```

### 2. Error Handling and Recovery
```python
async def safe_agent_execution(agent: AgentExecutor, task: str):
    try:
        result = await agent.ainvoke({"input": task})
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error and potentially retry or delegate
        return {"error": str(e), "task": task}
```

### 3. Memory Management
Implement proper state management between agent executions:

```python
class AgentMemoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation_history = []
        
    def store_context(self, agent_name: str, context: str):
        self.conversation_history.append({
            "agent": agent_name,
            "context": context
        })
```

## Architecture Patterns for Multi-Agent Systems

### 1. Agent Orchestration Pattern
```python
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {}
        
    async def execute_workflow(self, workflow: List[str], task: str):
        # Execute agents in specified order
        results = []
        current_task = task
        
        for agent_name in workflow:
            agent = self.agents[agent_name]
            result = await agent.execute(current_task)
            results.append(result)
            current_task = result["output"]
            
        return results
```

### 2. Task Decomposition Pattern
```python
class TaskDecomposer:
    def decompose_task(self, task: str) -> List[str]:
        # Break complex tasks into subtasks
        # Determine which agents can handle each subtask
        pass
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Execution**: Use asyncio for concurrent agent execution when possible
2. **Caching**: Cache results where appropriate to reduce redundant processing
3. **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and CPU usage for distributed agents
4. **Timeout Handling**: Implement timeouts to prevent hanging agents

## Integration with Existing Swarm Project

Based on your current Swarm project, you could enhance it by:

1. **Adding LangChain Dependencies**:
```python
# In requirements.txt or setup
langchain>=0.1.0
langchain-community>=0.1.0
langchain-core>=0.1.0
```

2. **Refactoring Current Agents**:
Convert your existing agents to use LangChain's AgentExecutor framework:
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Convert your existing planner to LangChain agent
planner_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a planning agent that breaks down tasks into actionable steps.
{task}
""")

planner_agent = AgentExecutor(
    agent=planner_prompt,
    tools=[],
    # Add your existing planning logic here
)
```

3. **Implementing Multi-Agent Coordination**:
```python
# In main.py or a new coordination module
async def run_multi_agent_workflow(task: str):
    # Initialize your agents
    planner = create_planner_agent()
    executor = create_executor_agent()
    critic = create_critic_agent()
    
    # Execute in proper sequence
    plan = await planner.ainvoke({"input": task})
    execution_result = await executor.ainvoke({"input": plan["output"]})
    final_review = await critic.ainvoke({"input": execution_result["output"]})
    
    return final_review
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Agent Collaboration
Implement agent collaboration through shared memory systems or message passing:
```python
class CollaborativeAgent:
    def __init__(self, shared_state: SharedState):
        self.shared_state = shared_state
        
    async def collaborate(self, task: str, collaborators: List[CollaborativeAgent]):
        # Share state with other agents
        # Coordinate actions
        pass
```

### 2. Adaptive Agent Selection
```python
class AdaptiveRouter:
    def select_best_agent(self, task: str, agent_scores: Dict[str, float]) -> str:
        # Select agent based on performance history
        # Adapt to changing conditions
        pass
```

## Conclusion

Implementing multiple agents with LangChain principles offers powerful capabilities for complex task execution. By applying these patterns to your existing Swarm project, you can create a robust multi-agent system that:

1. **Scales effectively** with proper agent composition
2. **Manages complexity** through structured communication patterns
3. **Handles diverse tasks** through specialized agents
4. **Maintains consistency** through shared state management
5. **Performs efficiently** with concurrent execution patterns

The key is to leverage LangChain's core concepts—agents, tools, memory, and execution frameworks—while maintaining compatibility with your existing infrastructure. Start with enhancing your current agent structure to incorporate these patterns, then gradually add more sophisticated coordination mechanisms as needed.

I'm yet to implement multipl agents but I'd like to get the routing setup to enable this in the future. Can you change the current setup so that we route and ultimately use the executor for our single instance?

```


## Assistant

Based on the code and documentation I've found, I can now explain the differences between these agents and why your current system sends all requests directly to Qwen3-Coder:

## Differences Between Planner, Executor, and Critic Agents

### Planner Agent
The Planner agent's role is to:
- **Break down user tasks into ordered actionable steps**
- **Create a structured plan** that defines what needs to be done
- **Analyze complexity** and determine the optimal sequence of operations
- **Generate executable instructions** for the Executor agent

### Executor Agent  
The Executor agent's role is to:
- **Execute the planned steps** using available tools
- **Handle specific tool calls** like file operations, shell commands, git operations
- **Process structured instructions** rather than natural language
- **Manage system interactions** through defined tools

### Critic Agent
The Critic agent's role is to:
- **Verify whether the task has been completed successfully**
- **Review execution results** and validate outcomes
- **Return either SUCCESS or FAILURE** with explanations
- **Act as quality control** for the entire process

## Why Your Current System Uses Qwen3-Coder Directly

Looking at your implementation, there are a few key points:

1. **Current Implementation Structure**: Your `gateway/fastapi_router.py` shows that all requests are proxied directly to the vLLM endpoint (`http://vllm:8000`), not routed through your agent framework.

2. **Agent Files Are Defined But Not Used**: The `planner.py`, `executor.py`, and `critic.py` files exist but are likely not connected to the main execution flow in your `main.py`.

3. **Docker Compose Integration**: Your Docker setup probably routes all traffic through the FastAPI gateway that forwards everything to the vLLM service running Qwen3-Coder.

## How to Implement Multi-Agent Architecture

To actually use all three agents together, you would need to modify your execution flow like this:

```python
# Pseudocode for multi-agent execution
async def run_multi_agent_task(task):
    # 1. Planner Phase
    plan_result = await planner.plan(task)
    steps = parse_plan(plan_result)
    
    # 2. Executor Phase  
    execution_results = []
    for step in steps:
        result = await executor.execute(step)
        execution_results.append(result)
    
    # 3. Critic Phase
    review_result = await critic.review(execution_results)
    
    return review_result
```

## Current vs. Multi-Agent Architecture

### Current State (Single Agent)
```
User Task → FastAPI Gateway → Qwen3-Coder (single LLM) → Response
```

### Desired Multi-Agent State
```
User Task → Planner Agent → Executor Agent → Critic Agent → Final Response
```

## Implementation Recommendation

To properly implement this multi-agent system, you need to:

1. **Create a Main Orchestrator** that connects the three agents:
```python
# Example orchestrator
async def orchestrate_task(task):
    # Get plan from planner
    plan = await planner.plan(task)
    
    # Execute steps
    results = []
    for step in parse_steps(plan):
        result = await executor.execute(step)
        results.append(result)
    
    # Review final output
    final_review = await critic.review(results)
    return final_review
```

2. **Modify your FastAPI routing** to handle agent-based requests instead of just proxying everything to the LLM.

3. **Set up proper tool integration** between the executor and your filesystem/shell tools.

The reason you're seeing all requests go directly to Qwen3-Coder is because your system is configured to route everything through the FastAPI gateway, which forwards all requests to the vLLM service. The agent structure exists conceptually but isn't currently wired into your execution flow.

Would you like me to help you implement this multi-agent orchestration system properly?
