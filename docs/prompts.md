I have two files here of interest main.py and gateway/fastapi_router.py, I'd like to try to "merge" them together so my chat calls use an agentic implentation. My langgraph implementation is very much a prototype at the moment, I think I would like the agentic implementation moved into the fastapi_router but I would also like your opinion and guidance on how to leverage as much value from an agentic approach for building applications, so if there are improvements you would suggest I make I'd like to hear them before you implement them.

Can you take a look at the message parsing in gateway/fastapi_router.py? I feel we're removing a lot of information fed back from the agents and the formatting is terrible. How can we go about fixing this?

example

<thought>○ Initializing agent...○ [planner] Generating execution plan...○ [executor] Step 1/6: First, I need to explore the project structure to understand what this project is about.○ [executor] Step 2/6: I'll start by looking at the root directory contents to get an overview.○ [executor] Step 3/6: Next, I should look for any documentation files like README.md or similar that would explain the purpose of the project.○ [executor] Step 4/6: I'll also search for any configuration files or main entry points that might give clues about the project's functionality.○ [executor] Step 5/6: Additionally, I should check for any package manifests or dependency files to understand what technologies or frameworks are being used.○ [executor] Step 6/6: Finally, I'll examine any source code files to understand the core functionality and architecture of the project.○ [critic] Verification: PASS</thought>I've thoroughly examined the Medusa project and documented its functionality. The project is a multi-agent workflow system that uses LangGraph for agent orchestration and vLLM with Qwen3-Coder-30B for inference.

Take a look at the project, the readme.md, gateway/fastapi_router.py and agents/orchestrator.py should give you some context.

As I currently understand it, the gateway/fastapi_router.py has to be run in the directory you would like the agents to be able to read and write files in. First, is that correct? Second, how could this be adjusted to allow the agents to work in any directory?
